1. **[Day 17 â€“ Boosting](Day_17_00_boosting.ipynb)**  
   Learned Boosting algorithms (like AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost).
   
2. **[Day 17.0 â€“ XGB & Parameters by Grid](Day_17_01_XGB_parametersByGridsearch.ipynb)**  
   how to tune their parameters using GridSearchCV.
   
3. **[Day 18 â€“ Stacking](Day_18_Stacking.ipynb)**  
   Learned Stacking (ensemble method where multiple models are combined with a meta-model for better performance).
   
4. **[Day 19 â€“ Nural Networks](Day_19_Nural_Networks.ipynb)**  
   Introduction to Neural Networks (NNs) â€” basics of neurons, layers, activation functions.
   
5. **[Day 20 â€“ NN with tensorflow](Day_20_NN_model_with_tensorflow.ipynb)**  
   Built a simple Neural Network model in TensorFlow/Keras, trained and evaluated it.
   
6. **[Day 21 â€“ .]()**  
   working on it.
